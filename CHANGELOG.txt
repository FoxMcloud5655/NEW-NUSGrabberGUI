0.89 beta

0.88 beta

- Fixed a bug reported by kavid - Japanese titles don't populate the list when JPN is selected.

0.86 beta
- Added a Help/FAQ button in the settings.
- Expanded the main window of the app to include the Title ID of a selected title.
- Added the ability to search by Title ID.  To search, search only by the last 8 hex values (An example: 10115E00).

0.85 beta
- Added project to GitHub!

- Added more comments for others to understand the code better once it's open source.

0.83 beta

0.81 beta
- Removed the annoying "&amp;" in the description from parsed HTML.
- Re-re-fixed (hopefully) yet another part of the bug "Title not found." If it doesn't work past this, then use the archived version in the settings.

- Program now safely removes files, as well as forcing others (like read-only ones) to be normal before deletion.

0.8 beta
- Re-fixed another part of the bug with the assumed file path.
- Fixed another popular bug "Unable to set directory"; the file path was being amended, not set.
